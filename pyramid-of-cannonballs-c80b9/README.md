## Goal
A pirate stacks his cannonballs in a pyramid. There is only one at the top of the pile. The cannonballs nest on top of each other; for a two-tiered pyramid, there are five cannonballs: four at the bottom, arranged in a square, and one at the top. Each tier is a square with a side length one unit larger than the tier above.

Calculate how many levels the pyramid would have if the pirate had N cannonballs to stack. If the given number of cannonballs does not make a perfect pyramid, print cannonball in the sea!

## Input
An integer N : for the number of cannonballs to be arranged in a pyramid.

## Output
Line 1 : the number of levels in the pyramid based on the number of cannonballs given by N, or cannonball in the sea!.

## Constraint
1 < N â‰¤ 70000
