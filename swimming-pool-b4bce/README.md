## Goal
For the summer, I need to fill my swimming pool with water.
I have drawn a schema of the pool using characters -, \, | and some others for better looking.
Each character represents 1 meter, except dash - which appears to be smaller and represents half a meter.

## Input
Line 1: An integer n for the number of lines describing the pool
Next n lines: A string representing isometric drawing of the pool, using characters -, \ and |.

## Output
An integer, the volume of the pool in cubic meters.

## Constraint
4 ≤ n ≤ 30

## Example
