## Goal
Your task is to solve a simple yet precise mathematical problem. You are given three integers A, B, and X. Your goal is to find all integers n that satisfy the following conditions:

n is a divisor of B
n is a multiple of A
n â‰¤ X

## Input
Line 1: Three integers A, B, and X separated by spaces.

## Output
A single line containing all the numbers n that satisfy the conditions, sorted in ascending order and separated by spaces. If no number satisfies the conditions, output None.

## Constraint
10^4 \> A \> 0
10^5 \> B \> 0
10^4 \> X \> 0
