## Goal
An array A contains N integers. One of them is said the Prevailing Element if it occurs in A at least floor(N/2) + 1 times.
You have to identify the Prevailing Element if it exists.

And as a challenge for you, try to solve it in O(N) time and O(1) space.

## Input
Line 1: An integer N that represent the length of A.
Next N Lines: One integer per line representing one element of A

## Output
Line 1: The Prevailing Element in A or N if it doesn't exist.

## Constraint
1 ≤ N ≤ 100000
