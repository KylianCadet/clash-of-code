## Goal
In an ancient library, a teacher discovers a strange manuscript.
Every word in it seems to be the result of a battle between vowels and consonants.

Given a single lowercase word s, output:

1. the number of vowels (letters in a,e,i,o,u,y)

2. the number of consonants (all other letters in a..z)

Print the two numbers on one line, separated by a space.

## Input
Line 1: A lowercase string s (a–z only).

## Output
Line 1: Two integers: vowels then consonants, separated by a space.

## Constraint
1 ≤ length of s ≤ 10
