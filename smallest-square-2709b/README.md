## Goal
Compute the area of the smallest axis-aligned square that contains the n given points of the plane.

An axis-aligned square has its sides vertical and horizontal not at an angle. The square contains a point if the point is inside or on the square.

## Input
Line 1 : An integer n for the number of points.
Next n lines : Two space separated integers x and y for the coordinates of a point.

## Output
Line 1 : An integer area for the area of the smallest axis-aligned square that contains all the given points.

## Constraint
2 ≤ n ≤ 20
-20 ≤ x ≤ 20
-20 ≤ y ≤ 20
1 ≤ area ≤ 1600
